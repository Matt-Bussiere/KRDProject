# KRDProject
Application to allow chemical engineering students to input problem conditions for Kinetics and Reactor Design course. It will deliver graphical outputs that the students 
can then use to compare their own code to. 
This is intended to help the students find bugs in their code that create the wrong answer such as a value accelerating too fast or slow 
and then looking and seeing what might cause that
The user should be able to input various problem conditions, but will be required to ensure all parameters have correct units.
The user will also have to determine certain parameters themselves such as the gas constant to be used in calculation.
The application works for CSTR,PFR,PBR and membrane reactors. If reversible reactions are present it is only set to work for a single reaction as of now.
